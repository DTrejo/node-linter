## Codenazi - code quality tool for javascript.

Codenazi doesn't implements own validators - it wrapps other available quality tools. 
Javascript lang is too flexible and it becomes very hard to work in larger teams, especially if some of members are newbie on javascript.
Codenazi is highly configurable, so if you don't want to use some rules, you can create your own conf file.

## Features
- all rules can be defined in one configuration ".json" file
- you can create many conf. files, because you might have different rules for different environments f.e. server and client.
- use of all available checker, independent of language it is written in, if you have one more - you can add it
